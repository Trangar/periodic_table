# Periodic Table

![](https://github.com/trangar/periodic_table/workflows/Quickstart/badge.svg)

This library provides a list of elements in the periodic table. For more info, see the [docs](https://docs.rs/periodic_table)

The data is provided from `data.csv` which was shamelessly borrowed from [https://github.com/andrejewski/periodic-table](https://github.com/andrejewski/periodic-table)
